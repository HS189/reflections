When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This would happen if you need to collaborate with many others and
  need a place where everyone can access the material.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  This would be inefficient and unnecessary, since it's more logical to stay
  up to date after each commit or each logical stop-point rather than
  continuously.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  This would allow you to work offline on the project and 
  add changes to the last known state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  It would be possible to share files individually with everyone
  each time changes are made. This may give users more control
  and would make the learning curve of git/github unnecessary, but
  it would be much more difficult to collaborate on a large scale.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  This allows you to make changes, try out new features, and experiment
  without working on and modifying your functioning product. This 
  is helpful so your main product wonâ€™t break if you
  try something new.
